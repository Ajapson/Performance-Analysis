# Performance Analysis (School, Product, Brand, etc.) 

## Overview  
What really drives success or failure — method, ability, effort, or something else?  
This project conducts a performance analysis across different domains (school, product, brand) to identify key drivers, visualize trends, and predict outcomes using machine learning (SVM & Naive Bayes).

## Key Insights & Recommendations 

### Method Effectiveness  
- One method shows a high success rate (~65%), while another shows low (~25%) — signaling areas to scale or revise.  
*Recommendation:* Standardize effective methods and reconsider ineffective ones.

### Ability Impacts Outcomes  
- Ability scores skew lower with moderate correlation (~53%) to success.  
*Recommendation:* Assess abilities early and offer personalized support to improve results.

### Time/Effort Linked to Method  
- Positive correlation (~33%) between time spent and method effectiveness.  
*Recommendation:* Encourage methods that boost engagement and effort.

### Past Performance Predicts Future Results  
- Past outcomes moderately predict current results (~32%).  
*Recommendation:* Identify and support low performers early.

## What to Avoid 
- Continuing ineffective methods without changes.  
- Treating all cases uniformly despite varying abilities or contexts.

## Final Note to Stakeholders  
Targeted improvements in methods, effort, and personalized support can significantly improve performance across different domains. Data shows clear patterns — invest smartly and act accordingly.
